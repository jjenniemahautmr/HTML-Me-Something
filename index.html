           <div> <h4>Traveling Hobby</h4>
        <p>   
       One of my favorite hobbies is traveling.  If I was not hindered by lack of funds, then I would travel at least
       once per season annually.  I want to travel to both domestic and international cities.  What I love about
       traveling is being able to submerse myself into a different culture and society to learn and observe customs
       different than my own.  One of my favorite places that I had visited is Chiang Mai, Thailand.</br></div>

        <div><h4>The Land of Smiles</h4>
       
        I had visited Chiang Mai, Thailand because that is my parents' birth country.  I had a fun time visiting my 
        relatives and visiting all of the Buddhist temples.  My favorite thing to do was heading to the open market to 
        buy food before a meal like breakfast.  My favorite temple is Doi Suthep which translates to God Mountain in 
        English.  The Buddhist Temple sits on top of a mountain that overlooks a breathtaking view as seen below.</br></div>

    </br>
        <div><h4>The Land of the Rising Sun</h4>
        The next city/country that I would like to visit is Tokyo, Japan.  I have been fascinated with Japan since I was
        two-years-old from their pop culture to their food to their advanced technology.  I am waiting on the edge of my
        seat for the right time to come along to finally visit.  Although I have only mentioned one city, there are other
        cities that I would like to visit either on the same or separate trip.  For my first time there, I think a tour
        guide would be sufficient to get around since Japan has some of the most populous cities and English is not spoken
        prevalently.  I hope that I will be able to visit this amazing country soon.  If not, there are other cities and 
        countries that I would like to visit, too.</div>
